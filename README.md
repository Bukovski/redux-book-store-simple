### Bookstore React-Redux project 

[Look into a live project](https://bukovski.github.io/redux-book-store-simple/ "live sample launch")

I use context for get load data to redux state and [redux-thunk](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk) for async requests.

I took this animation for a loading indicator from the [codepen link](https://codepen.io/xhepigerta/pen/bprWbR) and error animation from [codepen link](https://codepen.io/robinselmer/pen/MwOQxQ)
